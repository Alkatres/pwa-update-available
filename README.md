Have you ever been on a website and noticed a popup notification that suggests that there is a new version of the site available? I recently visited Google’s Inbox and noticed a notification a little like the image below.

This repo contains a basic example that will show you how to add a notification to your site and display it each time that there is a new version of the service worker available. You’ll also learn how to refresh the page, so that the user is up to date and has the latest version of any cached files. 

If you'd like to learn more and for a step by step guide, please visit my site at [deanhume.com](https://deanhume.com).
